Thanks for downloading my Medieval Sound Effects Pack! This pack contains 59 Sounds (Wav & MP3 Files), featuring my best sound effects packs

You can check my other music and sound effects packs at : https://www.gamedevmarket.net/member/AurelienMontero/

I hope these tracks will help you with your game. No need to give me credit or purchase a license to use these for any commercial game but I'd love to know how & when you use this music to share it with my audience !

If you have any question or if you would like to hire me to compose custom music for your game, you can reach me at : aurelien.montero@gmail.com
